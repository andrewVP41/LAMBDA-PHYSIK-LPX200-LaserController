# LAMBDA-PHYSIK-LPX200-LaserController
- LPX200.py is a python script for controlling, monitoring and collecting data from a laser used for materials research
-LaserDataCollection.py is a script for colecting data about the laser and storing it in an hdf5 file 


This program creates a UI that is used to control the laser through the communication interface. The operating elements are breiefly described below. I have also included the user manual for the laser. For more details on the control of the keypad, check pages 140-148 of the laser manual. My program performs all the operations that the keypad does with the exception of the function keys.
